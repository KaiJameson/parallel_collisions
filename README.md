This project uses the MPI c++ library to do parallel processing and simulate satellites flying around in low earth orbit. collisions.cpp is the main file for doing the parallel computing. 

The locations of all the satellites at every point that they are calculated is stored in sats.txt to be used for visualization. 

To view the satellites, load index.html and select the sats.txt file.
